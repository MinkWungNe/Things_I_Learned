# C++ Programming

This folder contains exercises and assignments from the university course **"C++ Programming"**.  
The course is designed to provide a solid foundation in programming using C++, starting from basic concepts and progressing to more advanced techniques.

## 📘 Course Description
The course covers both the fundamentals and intermediate/advanced features of the C++ language.  
Topics include:
- Basic syntax, input/output operations.
- Control structures (conditions, loops).
- Functions and modular programming.
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) with classes and objects.
- File handling: reading, writing, and modifying files.
- Exception handling for safe and robust programs.
- Simple applications involving file encryption and decryption.
- Introduction to basic data structures (arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues).
- Overview of common sorting algorithms (e.g., bubble sort, insertion sort, selection sort).

## 🛠️ Programming Language
- **C++** (main language for all exercises).

## 🎯 Learning Outcomes
By completing this course, I gained:
- The ability to write C++ programs from scratch.
- Experience with object-oriented programming concepts.
- Practical skills in handling files and working with exceptions.
- A deeper understanding of advanced C++ features.
- Familiarity with basic data structures and sorting algorithms.

## 📂 Repository Structure
This folder may contain:
- Sample programs demonstrating basic concepts.
- Object-oriented programming exercises.
- File handling and exception-handling assignments.
- Implementations of basic data structures and sorting algorithms.
- Small projects implemented in C++.

## 🚀 Notes
Because I'm not a native English speaker, some comments and variable names in the code may be in Vietnamese.
However, I strive to maintain clarity and consistency in my coding style.
This repository is part of my personal study log and coursework collection.
It reflects my progress in learning programming with C++ beyond the introductory level.
