# Data Structures And Algorithms

This folder contains exercises and assignments from the university course **"Data Structures and Algorithms"**.  
The course provides an in-depth study of fundamental data structures and algorithms, focusing on both theory and practical implementation.

## 📘 Course Description
The course explores how data can be organized, stored, and processed efficiently.  
Topics include:
- Core data structures: arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, heaps, and graphs.
- Searching and sorting algorithms.
- Recursion and divide-and-conquer techniques.
- Algorithm complexity analysis (time and space complexity).
- Introduction to advanced topics such as greedy algorithms and dynamic programming.
- Implementation of data structures and algorithms in **Java**.

## 🛠️ Programming Language
- **Java** (main language for all exercises).

## 🎯 Learning Outcomes
By completing this course, I gained:
- A strong understanding of common data structures and their applications.
- The ability to analyze and evaluate algorithm performance.
- Practical skills in implementing algorithms using Java.
- A foundation for solving computational problems more effectively.

## 📂 Repository Structure
This folder may contain:
- Implementations of core data structures.
- Solutions to algorithmic problems.
- Example code demonstrating searching and sorting techniques.
- Assignments and mini-projects in Java.

## 🚀 Notes
Because I'm not a native English speaker, some comments and variable names in the code may be in Vietnamese.
However, I strive to maintain clarity and consistency in my coding style.
