# Principles Of Programming Languages

This folder contains exercises and assignments from the university course **"Principles of Programming Languages"**.  
The course serves as an introduction to the fundamental concepts of programming, focusing on both the **logic of programming** and the **practical skills of coding**.

## 📘 Course Description
The course introduces the core principles behind programming languages and aims to build a strong foundation for problem-solving using programming.  
Topics covered include:
- Basic programming logic and flow control (conditions, loops).
- Data types, variables, and operators.
- Functions and modular programming.
- Arrays, pointers, and memory concepts.
- Fundamental problem-solving through programming.

Although the course is named *Principles of Programming Languages*, it primarily focuses on learning the **C++ language** as the medium for exploring these concepts.

## 🛠️ Programming Language
- **C++** (main language used in all exercises).

## 🎯 Learning Outcomes
By completing this course, I gained:
- The ability to understand and apply basic programming logic.
- Hands-on experience with C++ programming.
- A foundation for studying advanced programming concepts and other languages in the future.

## 📂 Repository Structure
This folder may contain:
- Lecture-related code examples.
- Exercise solutions.
- Small assignments/projects written in C++.

## 🚀 Notes
Because I'm not a native English speaker, some comments and variable names in the code may be in Vietnamese.  
However, I strive to maintain clarity and consistency in my coding style.
This repository is part of my larger collection of university coursework.  
It is intended for reference, practice, and personal documentation.
